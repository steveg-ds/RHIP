# RHIP

This R project contains all the code used in the thesis "Rurality and Robustness: Rural Areas and Housing Insecurity Risk" 

All of the code may not be available in the public repository as in the final crunch to finish my thesis all semblance of order went out the door. I am working to get it all organized and on the public repository as soon as possible. 

How it works: 

ACS Data Collection.R

Accesses the Census API and collects processes American Community Survey (ACS) data. It verifies and sets the Census API key, and reads FIPS codes from a CSV file. It then collects the needed ACS variables for the year 2021. Finally, the data is saved as a CSV file for further analysis.
